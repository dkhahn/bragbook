        <h1>This Web Page is the "Parent Element" and is made up of smaller "Child Components"</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>A Web Page is comprised of components. Child components are what the parent site is comprised of. Each colored box is a component. You can view a website as the sum total of its components. This same framework can be applied to any type of task.</li>
            <li>You can break down a task/initative into components and gameplan how to solve each component, ultimately solving the large task.</li>
            <li>This strategy can help with defining a completion timeline, identifying mission critical components, task prioritization/segmentation, delegating work, and hollistically viewing your workload.</li>
